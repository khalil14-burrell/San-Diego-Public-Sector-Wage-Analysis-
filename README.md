# San-Diego-Public-Sector-Wage-Analysis-=
This project analyzes public sector wages for teachers in San Diego County, with a specific focus on teachers who have switched school districts. Using data obtained through web scraping from a government website, the analysis aims to determine if teachers who switch districts earn significantly more than those who remain in the same district. Additionally, this project uses Power BI to model the potential tax implications if teacher salaries were equalized across minimum, median, and maximum salary levels within each district.

# Project Overview
- Data Collection: A web scraper was developed to gather salary data from public sources, specifically focusing on teacher salaries across various school districts in San Diego County.
-Data Analysis: Using a Jupyter Notebook, the data was cleaned and analyzed to investigate salary differences. The primary question explored was whether teachers who switch districts receive a significant increase in earnings compared to those who stay.
- Tax Impact Modeling: Power BI was utilized to model the tax expenditures if teacher salaries were equalized at the minimum, median, and maximum levels within each district. This analysis offers insights into the financial impact on local government spending based on different salary standardization scenarios.
